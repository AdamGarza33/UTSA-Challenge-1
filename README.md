# UTSA-Challenge-1

## What is this challenge and the requirements to complete the challenge?
The focus for this challenge was for the student to locate the div tags that were used in HTML and replace them with the appropriate HTML element tags. Once the HTML div tags were replaced with the new HTML element tags, the student then had to go into CSS to change the CSS tags to be compatible with what was changed in HTML. 

## What order did the steps have to be in to complete this challenge?
* Every div tag was located in order to assess the content that was carried within. 
* All CSS tags that have a correlation to the HTML div tags were identified in CSS. 
* All div tags were inspected and studied to determine what HTML semantic tags needed to be used. 
* All CSS tags were inspected and studied to determine what CSS tag correlated with the HTML semantic tag that was changed in HTML and change it to the exact tag in CSS. 
* Locate the missing id tag and insert an id tag.
* A comment was placed on every change to recount why it was made. 

## What other changes were made for the Challenge?
The only change that was made was a missing id= tag in the article container with the content "online-reputation-management".
